## Overview

**SecondHand** is a classic e-commerce platform tailored for pre-loved items. It facilitates a circular economy by connecting buyers and sellers in a unified platform where every user can be both a merchant and a customer.

## Key Features

*   **Dual Role**: Single account for both buying and selling.
*   **Category Filtering**: Easy navigation through diverse product categories.
*   **Negotiation Feature**: Built-in chat/offer system to negotiate prices.

## Technical Highlights

A robust implementation of **MVVM Clean Architecture**. Note that this project uses **Dagger/Hilt** and **Retrofit**, demonstrating solid proficiency in the standard Android tech stack before the shift to Koin/Compose.
