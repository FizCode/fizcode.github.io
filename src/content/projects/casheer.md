## Overview

**Casheer** is a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) application designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). It addresses the critical need for an efficient, easy-to-use system to track sales, manage inventory, and generate real-time reports.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Inventory Management**: Automatically updates stock levels as sales are made.
*   **Sales Tracking**: Detailed logs of every transaction.
*   **Reports & Analytics**: Visual graphs showing daily, weekly, and monthly performance.
*   **Offline Mode**: Fully functional even without an internet connection, syncing data when back online.

## Technical Highlights

Built using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** basics to ensure future scalability across platforms. The UI is crafted 100% with **Jetpack Compose** for a modern, reactive user experience. We utilized **Koin** for dependency injection and **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** architecture to ensure unidirectional data flow and easy testing.
